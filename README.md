# LMSTools ython3 library for LMS server & player

This is a clone of the python library for a Logitech Media server

[https://github.com/elParaguayo/LMSTools](https://github.com/elParaguayo/LMSTools)

I have port the project to python3 on raspbian strech, and used it on raspberry pi
- to build a DIY USB controller/LMS Player for a mini-dsp DDRC-24 [https://www.minidsp.com/products/dirac-series/ddrc-24](https://www.minidsp.com/products/dirac-series/ddrc-24) on my home HIFI setup
- to interface a voice control of my LMS player with qobuz using a google assistant and the **Home Assistant** home automation system [https://www.home-assistant.io/](https://www.home-assistant.io/)


LMSTools (original)
========

A very easy to use python library for interacting with your Logitech Media Server and players.
